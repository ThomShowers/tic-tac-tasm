# tictasm
*_A tic tac toe game in x86 ASM... but I don't know what I'm doing_*

## What

tictasm is a pet project I'm using to learn about assembly, the build toolchain, and python.

The project includes (or will eventually include):
- game objects written in assembly
- platform specific objects where required (io, memory management, etc.)
- a platform aware build system
- a unit test suite and framework to test the objects using FFI proxys

## Why

I'm interested in low level programming and tool building, this seems like a good way to explore those topics.
